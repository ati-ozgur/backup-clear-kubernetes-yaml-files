# backup-clear-kubernetes-yaml-files

This repository is about taking clear kubernetes yaml files for backup.
I know you are supposed to implement gitops/devops and yaml files are supposed to be in the repository.
But reality is sometimes you can not enforce this policy and you would like to get backup clear yaml files from your current kubernetes cluster.
